# NOTES TO SELF
===========================================

## view encapsulation
the css from a components own css file is placed in the index.html file in a style tag with other styles, so how does it not effect global styling? It doesn't because a new unique attributed is added to elements selected for styling. This attribute is also added to the selector itself. This added specificity of selectioin results in view encapsulation ie scoping of styles to the component html. 

# Firebase config and deployment
